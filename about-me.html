    <h3>1993</h3>
    <p>Ah the 90's, simpler times. I remember pokemon cards, gameboy's and playstations, nickelodeon and playing out in the neighbourhood. I had a good childhood and I know my parents did the best with what they had to make it as good as I remember.

    <h3>Always On The Move</h3>
    <p>I moved out when I was 17, maybe a choice I could have spent more time thinking about, but I was just so eager to be mature and independant that I took off at a young age and moved to Huddersfield to study graphic design at University. It didn't work out for personal reasons, and I now live in Leeds, currently working from home due to the COVID-19 crisis.</p>

    <h3>Career Change</h3>
    <p>I had to find work to pay bills to support myself so I had to find work quickly, but I still have that passion for seeing everything as art and wanting to know how it was designed. Which is why after working in customer service one way or another now for far too long, I am tackling the challenge of teaching myself this coding and web developement stuff. It's gonna be hard but I am ready to move on again and leave my comfort zone, something I've had to do alot in my life.</p>
